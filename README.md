# 📊 Multiple Linear Regression – Startup Profit Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict the **profit of startups** based on various independent factors such as R&D Spend, Administration cost, Marketing Spend, and State.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that analyzes how multiple business factors influence a startup’s profit.  
It demonstrates how multiple independent variables can be used together to make accurate predictions.

This project follows a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model prediction.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset used is **50_Startups.csv**, which includes the following features:

- **R&D Spend**
- **Administration**
- **Marketing Spend**
- **State** (Categorical Variable)
- **Profit** (Target Variable)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded and explored the dataset  
3. Encoded categorical variables (State)  
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Trained the Multiple Linear Regression model  
6. Predicted startup profits using test data  

## 📈 Model Explanation
Multiple Linear Regression establishes a relationship between:
- **One dependent variable (Profit)**
- **Multiple independent variables (business expenses and state)**

This allows the model to evaluate the combined impact of different business decisions on profitability.
